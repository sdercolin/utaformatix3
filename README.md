## Get started for development

1. Install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
2. Clone and import as a Gradle project
3. Configure IDEA's Gradle settings with `JDK 17` and `Use Gradle Wrapper`
4. Run by `./gradlew jsRun` or Gradle Task `other/jsRun`
5. Optionally, run by `./gradlew jsRun --continuous` with live reloading enabled

## Contribution

Code contribution is welcomed. Basically, please cut your branch from `develop` and make Pull Requests towards `develop`
branch.

#### Adding a format support

Please check [Format.kt](src/jsMain/kotlin/model/Format.kt) and its usages.

#### Adding a Language

Please check [Strings.kt](src/jsMain/kotlin/ui/strings/Strings.kt).

#### Adding a configurable process

Please check [ConfigurationEditor.kt](src/jsMain/kotlin/ui/ConfigurationEditor.kt)
about how the existing processes work.

#### Build/Format check

Pull requests require build check to be merged. Besides normal building of the project, a format check is conducted.
Please confirm that the `build` and `ktlintCheck` Gradle tasks pass before submitting your code.

You may find `ktlintFormat` task helpful, which helps fix most format problems.

If your IDE's formatter is conflicting with `ktlint`, please import format settings
from [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) (IntelliJ IDEA uses it by default).
